## 1.0.1 (2018-11-25)

- Small improvement of error message strings.
- Included new version of inpout32.dll from https://www.highrez.co.uk/Downloads/InpOut32/

## 1.0  (2018-02-18)

- *Linux*: Prevent endless and meaningless transmission that occurred when one of the source file names was actually a directory.
- *Linux*: Replaced `usleep()` by `nanosleep()` for the .
- Do not exit immediately if a destination file exists and the -f option is not given. Instead, continue with the next file from the SOURCE list.

- Updated included header file for `open()` function.
- Made some inline functions static.

## 0.9 (2008-11-16)

- *Windows*: Increased argument to usleep() in order to have the delay take effect. This issue caused frequent transmission errors on fast computers.
- Fixed checksum evaluation which failed when the result was 0.
- Transmitting zero length files to the Portfolio did not work.
- Display correct file name in "File not found" error message when transmitting a file to the Portfolio.
- Improved synchronization and error handling for data transmission
- Accept command line switches starting with '/' in addition to the syntax using '-'.
- Allow wildcards for SOURCE and directories for DEST when receiving files (e.g. transfolio -r *.txt stories)
- Minor changes of error messages, writing to stderr rather than stdout
- Changed exit codes
- Declared getBit() as inline function
- *DOS*: Use `malloc()` instead of big `payload[]` array, include appropriate header for `usleep()`

## 0.8  (2006-08-28)

## 0.5
